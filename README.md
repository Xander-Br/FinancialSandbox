# Exploration of Trading Universe Sandbox üìà

## An Optibook Imitation

Hello! I'm Alexandre, and this project is my sandbox for exploring concepts relevant to the financial markets, particularly focusing on technologies commonly used in the industry.

## Motivation

My primary goal is to deepen my understanding and gain practical experience with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, as these are frequently required skills for roles in the financial technology sector where I am currently seeking opportunities. This project serves as a hands-on learning tool.

Inspired by **Optiver's Optibook** (a tool often used in their hackathons to simulate a trading environment), this sandbox aims to recreate aspects of a market simulation, allowing me to experiment different aspect of working as a developer in a bank or fintech.

## Current Status & Features

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is currently under active development.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

As of **April 14, 2025**, the core functionality includes:

* **Synthetic Market Data Generation:** A simple, one-sided market data feed is simulated using the **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** algorithm. This provides a basic stream of price movements to mimic market activity.
* **Real-time Data Streaming:** Market ticks generated by the GBM model are streamed via WebSockets (using STOMP over SockJS) to a basic frontend for visualization.
* **Data Persistence:** Market ticks are stored in a **TimescaleDB** database, set up via Docker Compose and managed with Flyway migrations.

## Architecture

The project is currently being built using **Spring Modulith**. This architectural style is being explored to help structure the application into logical modules within a monolithic deployment, aiming for better organization and maintainability as the project grows.

## Technologies Used (So Far)

* **Backend:** Java (JDK 21+), Spring Boot 3.x
* **Architecture:** Spring Modulith
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension
* **Database Migration:** Flyway
* **Containerization:** Docker / Docker Compose
* **Real-time:** Spring WebSockets, STOMP, SockJS
* **Build:** Maven

## Getting Started (Preliminary)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Java JDK 21 or higher
    * Maven
    * Docker & Docker Compose
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
3.  **Run the database :**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4.  **Build and Run the application:**
    ```bash
    # Using Maven
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run

    # Using Gradle
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
5.  Access the frontend/API at `http://localhost:8080` (or the configured port).

*(Note: Setup instructions may evolve as the project develops.)*

## TODO / Future Plans üöÄ

The following areas are planned for development:

* [ ] **Rework DTOs & Shared Files:** Refactor Data Transfer Objects and potentially shared data structures for better clarity and maintainability between modules/components.
* [ ] **Implement Order Book:** Develop a proper order book mechanism to handle different order types (limit, market) and maintain the state of buy/sell orders for simulated instruments. 
* [ ] **FIX Protocol Builder/Parser:** Implement functionality to construct and potentially parse Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol messages.
